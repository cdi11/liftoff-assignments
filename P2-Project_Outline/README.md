## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is an application set up by parents to limit children’s screen time.  At my house children think they should be able to get on their devices any time they want.  This has led to some of them having trouble getting homework done on time and not finishing jobs they are expected to do around the house.  We have tried to set up times for screen time and time to get things done.  This has been viewed as “punishment” by children.  I wanted to set this up so that screen time would be seen as a reward to be earned not a right to be taken away.

The application will have several user inputs and levels.  Parents will be able to use all of the screens in the application.  Children will only be able to use their own screens.  They will be able to add jobs and rewards under their name, while parents will be able to manage everyone’s accounts.  When it is all build parents will be able to give access to devices in the house and set time limits for each child in the house when expectations are met for the day.  The application will set time limits, to be edited by parents, based on what the child has done and how much time they have.

### Features
User login:  Each user will have an account and be able to access certain features based on what they level.

Sessions: Users will be able to make changes while they are signed in on a session.

Multiple Databases linked together:  A lot of information is going to have to be held and presented together so they need to be linked to each other.

SMS:  Sending text messages to parents when a child has recored a job being finished so they can confirm or deny if the task is completed correctly.

Linking Devices:  I need some feature that will link all of the devised in the house to a parent device so a parent can manage all of the devices from one computer or phone.
